# Three.js FPS Aim Trainer ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

The FPS Aim Trainer is a 3D interactive project built using Three.js. It simulates a first-person shooting environment where players can practice their aim by shooting at dynamic targets. The game features adjustable difficulty levels, recoil mechanics, particle effects, and collision detection. Uses ray-casting.
